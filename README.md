This project is designed to host a set of [Salt](http://saltstack.com/) states and formulae to govern the installation and configuration of the Splunk Enterprise security-software components. These formulae and states take care of downloading required software components, installing and configuring those components and updating the host firewall with required exceptions for the components to be managed from the Enterprise consoles.
