This Salt formula makes use of externalized values. Externalization of values allows the project-managed state-files to both be rendered more portable without having to hard-code in potentially sensitive data. Externalized values may be stored either within SaltStack's "grains" construct or "pillars" construct. This example assumes the use of the "grains" construct.

The states in this formula expect the following values to be defined:
  - `repo_splunk:` Setting this value allows the Salt-states to determine where configuration file elements are being stored. Stored values should include the method and URI-root to the installable configuration file elements. Example values include 'salt://repo', 'http://reposerver', 's3://myrepo.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com', 'file:///var/tmp/stage', etc.
  - `deployment_type:` Setting this value allows the Salt-states to determine which type of deployment the states are supporting. Example values include 'dev', 'prod', etc. (not currently implemented)
  - `deployment_env:` Setting this value allows the Salt-states to determine what type of hosting-environment the states are supporting. Example values include 'AWS', 'OpenStack', etc. (not currently implemented)
